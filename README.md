# O-Ring-Gland-Design-Document
A quantitative, engineering-grade technical reference for O-ring gland design across multiple seal applications. This repository contains interpolated design data, parametric selection charts, and worked examples for standard metric cross-sections (1-6 mm), compiled from industry handbooks and validated against ISO 3601/DIN 3771 standards.
# O-Ring Gland Design Reference Documentation

## 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains a **comprehensive technical reference guide** for engineers and researchers designing O-ring seals and gland geometries. The project consolidates design principles and data from three authoritative industry handbooks and presents them in a quantitative, interpolated format suitable for metric cross-sections (1-6 mm) not typically covered in standard catalogs.

### Project Purpose
- Provide **quantitative design guidance** for O-ring gland selection
- Enable **metric region adoption** of seal design standards
- Facilitate **academic and professional portfolio development** through structured technical documentation
- Serve as an **educational resource** for marine engineering, mechanical design, and fluid systems courses

### Target Users
- **Design Engineers**: Hydraulic systems, pneumatic systems, marine vehicles
- **Graduate Researchers**: Vehicle dynamics, hydrodynamics, seal technology
- **Students**: Mechanical engineering, marine engineering, systems design
- **Technical Professionals**: Seal manufacturers, component designers, validation engineers
